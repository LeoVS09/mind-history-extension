      Background scripts are loaded as soon as the extension is loaded 
      and stay loaded until the extension is disabled or uninstalled, 
      unless persistent is specified as false. 
      You can use any of the WebExtension APIs in the script, 
      as long as you have requested the necessary permissions.
